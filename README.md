* [Project 2. Game: Battleship game](https://github.com/chingachguk1977/Battleship-game)

Роман Быков (SF, FPW-58)

The repository contains the classic Battleship game. Now AI vs Human implemented.

The file with the code is self-explanatory, thoroughly commented. Change MAX_COORD constant in the Board class, to adjust the board dimensions. Do not make it more than 10, as the board will not look nice otherwise.
GLHF!
